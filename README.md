I'll add a bit of documentation when I get to that. For now see also [my Stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/37360733/893774).

Credit goes to the kind contributors of JPSVolumeButtonHandler, which does all the heavy lifting.

Notice some issues I submitted [here](https://github.com/jpsim/JPSVolumeButtonHandler/issues/37).
